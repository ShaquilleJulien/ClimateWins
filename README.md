# ClimateWins
# ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project 
## Overview 
ClimateWins is interested in more practical applications of machine learningâ€“for
instance, if machine learning can be used to help predict the consequences of climate change
around Europe and, potentially, the world. This is the second part of a two-part project. The project consists of using advanced machine learning algorithms. 

# Objectives 
 - Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
 - Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
 - Based on current trends, generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years.
 - Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years.

# Dataset 
The data set was data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations
across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for
almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and
more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.

# Thought Process for ClimateWIn
- Discovering New Patterns In Historical Weather Changes: Using Random Forest to identify key drivers of historical weather changes.
- Identifying and Tracking Unusual Weather Patterns in Europe: Use of CNN to process spatial and temporal climate data to detect weather irregularities in Europe.
- Future Weather Generation And Climate Safety Mapping: Using Generative Adversarial Network

# Deep Learning Technique adopted
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Developed a CNN to classify visual weather patterns, analyzing images representing various weather conditions such as cloudy, sunny, and rainy.
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Utilized RNNs to forecast time-series weather data by leveraging sequential patterns.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied optimization techniques, including grid search and random search, to enhance model performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices to ensure robust and reliable performance.
