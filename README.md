# ClimateWins
# ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project 
## Overview 
ClimateWins is interested in more practical applications of machine learningâ€“for
instance, if machine learning can be used to help predict the consequences of climate change
around Europe and, potentially, the world. This is the second part of a two-part project. The project consists of using advanced machine learning algorithms. 

# Objectives 
 - Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
 - Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
 - Generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based
  on current trends.
 - Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years.
