# ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project 
## Overview 
ClimateWins is interested in more practical applications of machine learningâ€“for
instance, if machine learning can be used to help predict the consequences of climate change
around Europe and, potentially, the world. This is the second part of a two-part project. The project consists of using advanced machine learning algorithms.
